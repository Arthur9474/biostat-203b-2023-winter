### Overall Grade: 106/120

### Quality of report: 10/10

- Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? Take 10 pts per day for late submission.

    Yes

- Is the final report in a human readable format html?

    Yes

- Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (R markdown/Quarto) for better reproducibility?

    Yes

- Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how results are produced by just reading the report? Take some points off if the solutions are too succinct to grasp, or there are too many typos/grammar. 

    Yes

### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: 58/70

- Q1 (10/10)

- Q2 (20/20)

- Q3 (9/20)

    #4: We should count the number of lines after displaying the compressed file using i.e., `zcat/gzcat`. `-5.0`
    
    #5: 256878 is correct, but we expect you to display it by code. `-1.0`
    
    #6: We should report the count for each unique value of these variables. For example, the first line in `admission_type` should be `7254 AMBULATORY OBSERVATION`. `-5.0` 


- Q4 (10/10)

- Q5 (9/10)

    `history | tail` is missing. `-1.0` Let me know if you have a special reason.
	    
### Usage of Git: 10/10

- Are branches (`main` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `main` branch?

    Yes

- Are there enough commits (>=5) in develop branch? Are commit messages clear? The commits should span out not clustered the day before deadline.

    Yes
          
- Is the hw1 submission tagged? 

    Yes

- Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly?

    Yes

### Reproducibility: 8/10

- Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `main` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? Just click the `render` button will produce the final `html`? 

    Q4.1: We should run the `wget` command to download `pg42671.txt` in the background by `#| eval: true`. `-1.0`

    Q4.1: We expect you to display the number of times each of the four characters on html by `#| eval: true`. `-1.0`

- If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?

### R code style: 20/20
